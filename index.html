            <h1>Kittens</h1>
            <h2>And also things.</h2>
            <p>Even though boths kittens and things are deeply important, rememebr that HTML tagging is important                as well.</p>
            <p>The tag <code>h1</code> will denote the most important heading <em>per container that it exists                    in</em>.</p>
            <p>This means that <code>h1</code> can be used several times, and will be treated differently each                    time. As can already be seen, the heading for "Kittens and Things" in the <code>header</code>                      container and the heading "Kittens" in the <code>article</code> container already look different,                  even though both are under a <code>h1</code> tag.</p>
