                    “Just what in the hell is going on?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s one of the most basic questions that we, as humans, ask about the world around us. Indeed, the ability to ask such a question is an absolute prerequisite to even be considered human, so deep is its importance to us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For millennia, humanity has worked tirelessly to answer that question, with society as we know it rising up as a reward for that endeavor. Through the arts and sciences, mankind has made tremendous advances in understanding exactly what the hell is happening in the world around us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, the task is not complete.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Center for Fabricated Research was founded in 2014 with the aim of being one of the greatest centers of learning that the world has ever seen. With virtually limitless imaginary resources and unparalleled non-existent access to the world-wide scientific community, The CFR has attracted some of the best and brightest to its cause.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are a group of scientists, medical doctors, engineers, educators, and leaders wholly dedicated to the cause of advancing human knowledge through any means necessary – even subterfuge.  
                </p>
                <h2>
                What We Do
                </h2>

                <p>
                    The CFR is a research center first and foremost. With thousands of labs spanning all possible disciplines, the CFR is uniquely situated to address any concern, at any time, by any means necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, we also engage in extensive community out-reach projects: open lecture programs, museum collaboration efforts, after-school programs. We understand the human side of science, and do our best to bring it to those that need it most.
